### Build and launch the database

If you have not already done so, start up a MongoDB database:

- run command, `docker run --name mongodb_dockerhub -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mongo:latest`

The back-end code will integrate with this database. However, it may be occasionally useful interact with the database directly from the command line:

- connect to the database server from the command line: `docker exec -ti mongodb_dockerhub mongosh -u admin -p secret`
- show the available databases: `show dbs`
- select the database used by this app: `use example`
- exit the database shell whenever you have had your fill: `exit`

If you have trouble running Docker on your computer, use a database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) instead. Atlas is a "cloud" MongoDB database service with a free option. Create a database there, and make note of the connection string, username, password, etc.

### Create a `.env` file

A file named `.env` is necessary to run the application. This file contains sensitive environment variables holding credentials such as the database connection string, username, password, etc. This file should be excluded from version control in the [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) file.

An example file named `env.example` is given. Copy this into a file named `.env` and edit the values to match your database. If following the instructions and using Docker to run the database, the values should be:

```
MONGO_DBNAME=example
MONGO_URI="mongodb://admin:secret@localhost:27017/example?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

The other values can be left alone.

### Run the app

- define two environment variables from the command line:
  - on Mac, use the commands: `export FLASK_APP=app.py` and `export FLASK_ENV=development`.
  - on Windows, use `set FLASK_APP=app.py` and `set FLASK_ENV=development`.
- start flask with `flask run` - this will output an address at which the app is running locally, e.g. https://127.0.0.1:5000. Visit that address in a web browser.
- in some cases, the command `flask` will not be found when attempting `flask run`... you can alternatively launch it with `python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000` (or change to `python -m ...` if the `python3` command is not found on your system).

Note that this will run the app only on your own computer. Other people will not be able to access it. If you want to allow others to access the app running on your local machine, try using the [flask-ngrok](https://pypi.org/project/flask-ngrok/) module.
